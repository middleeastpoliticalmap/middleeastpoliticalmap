<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>North America is home to an extensive network of highways that connect cities, states, and countries. In 2023, the map of North American highways has undergone several changes, with new highways being added, some highways being upgraded, and others being decommissioned. In this article, we will take a closer look at the map of North American highways in 2023.</p>
<h2>The Major Highways in North America</h2>
<p>The North American highway system comprises several major highways that crisscross the continent. Some of the most notable highways include:</p>
<h3>1. Interstate Highway System</h3>
<p>The Interstate Highway System is a network of highways in the United States that spans over 46,000 miles. It connects major cities and towns across the country, making it one of the most important highways in North America.</p>
<h3>2. Trans-Canada Highway</h3>
<p>The Trans-Canada Highway is a 4,860-mile highway that connects all ten provinces of Canada. It is the longest national highway in the world and is an important part of the North American highway system.</p>
<h3>3. Mexico Federal Highways</h3>
<p>The Mexico Federal Highways is a network of federal highways in Mexico that spans over 110,000 kilometers. It connects major cities and towns across the country and is an important part of the North American highway system.</p>
<h2>New Highways in North America</h2>
<p>In 2023, several new highways have been added to the North American highway system. Some of the most notable new highways include:</p>
<h3>1. The I-11 Highway</h3>
<p>The I-11 Highway is a new highway that connects Las Vegas, Nevada, and Phoenix, Arizona. It is a part of the Interstate Highway System and is expected to relieve congestion on the I-10 highway.</p>
<h3>2. The Ontario Highway 413</h3>
<p>The Ontario Highway 413 is a new 59-kilometer highway that will connect the cities of Brampton and Vaughan in Ontario, Canada. It is expected to ease traffic congestion in the Greater Toronto Area.</p>
<h3>3. The Mexico City-Toluca Highway</h3>
<p>The Mexico City-Toluca Highway is a new 57-kilometer highway that connects Mexico City to Toluca. It is expected to reduce travel time and ease congestion on the existing highways.</p>
<h2>Upgraded Highways in North America</h2>
<p>Several highways in North America have undergone upgrades in 2023. Some of the most notable upgrades include:</p>
<h3>1. The I-405 Freeway</h3>
<p>The I-405 Freeway in California has undergone a major upgrade that includes the addition of a new lane in each direction, new bridges, and new sound walls. The upgrade is expected to ease congestion on the freeway.</p>
<h3>2. The Highway 401</h3>
<p>The Highway 401 in Ontario, Canada, has undergone a major upgrade that includes the addition of new lanes, new bridges, and new interchanges. The upgrade is expected to improve traffic flow on the highway.</p>
<h3>3. The I-10/I-17 Interchange</h3>
<p>The I-10/I-17 Interchange in Phoenix, Arizona, has undergone a major upgrade that includes the addition of new ramps and bridges. The upgrade is expected to ease congestion on the interchange.</p>
<h2>Decommissioned Highways in North America</h2>
<p>Some highways in North America have been decommissioned in 2023 due to various reasons. Some of the most notable decommissioned highways include:</p>
<h3>1. The Alaska Route 10</h3>
<p>The Alaska Route 10, also known as the Dalton Highway, has been decommissioned due to safety concerns. The highway was notorious for being one of the most dangerous highways in North America.</p>
<h3>2. The US Route 666</h3>
<p>The US Route 666, also known as the &#8220;Devil&#8217;s Highway,&#8221; has been decommissioned due to its controversial name. The highway was renamed to US Route 491.</p>
<h3>3. The Quebec Autoroute 440</h3>
<p>The Quebec Autoroute 440 has been decommissioned due to its age and poor condition. The highway was replaced by the new Autoroute 85.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The map of North American highways in 2023 has undergone several changes, with new highways being added, some highways being upgraded, and others being decommissioned. These changes are aimed at improving traffic flow, reducing congestion, and enhancing safety on the highways. As we move into the future, we can expect more changes to the North American highway system as new technologies and innovations emerge.</p>
